**File Templating Engine**

Stencil is a lightweight templating engine that combines performance and flexibility. It caches parsed templates for fast reuse, dynamically evaluates runtime values, and supports conditional injection so templates adapt to context.

If you need more functionality, Please create an issue at [**Stencil Repo**](https://github.com/bitlaab-bolt/stencil) and buy us some coffee.
